<tr><td>Beginning with the 2012-13 school year, accountability reports changed significantly as a result of Massachusetts’ waiver of certain No Child Left Behind (NCLB) requirements: the NCLB goal of 100 percent proficiency was replaced with a new goal of reducing proficiency gaps by half by 2017; the NCLB accountability status labels of improvement, corrective action, and restructuring were eliminated; only state accountability and assistance levels are used for districts and schools, including charter schools; Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) has been replaced with a new performance measure (the Progress and Performance Index, or PPI) that incorporates student growth and other indicators, including science and dropout rates; and reports show a new "high needs" subgroup, an unduplicated count of all students in a school or district belonging to at least one of the following individual subgroups: students with disabilities, English language learners (ELL) and former ELL students, or low income students</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p><span class="bold">Accountability and Assistance Level:</span> Massachusetts' <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/apa/general/">Framework for District Accountability</a> and Assistance classifies schools and districts on a five-level scale, classifying those meeting their gap narrowing goals in Level 1 and the lowest performing in Level 5. Approximately eighty percent of schools are classified into Level 1 or 2 based on the cumulative PPI for the "all students" and high needs groups. For a school to be classified into Level 1, the cumulative PPI for both the "all students" group and high needs students must be 75 or higher. If not, the school is classified into Level 2. A school may also be classified into Level 2 if it has low MCAS participation rates for any group (between 90 and 94%).<br /><br />Schools are classified into Level 3 if they are among the lowest 20 percent relative to other schools in the same school type category statewide, if one or more subgroups in the school are among the lowest performing 20% of subgroups relative to all subgroups statewide, if they have persistently low graduation rates (less than 60% for any subgroup over a four-year period), or if they have very low MCAS participation rates for any group (less than 90%). The lowest achieving, least improving Level 3 schools are candidates for classification into Levels 4 and 5, the most serious designations in Massachusetts' accountability system. <br /><br />A small number of schools each year will not be classified into a level: small schools, schools ending in grades 1 or 2, new schools, or schools that were substantially reconfigured.<br /><br />In general, a district is classified into the level of its lowest performing school, unless the district was independently classified into Level 4 or 5 as a result of action by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Determination of need for technical assistance or intervention in the area of special education:</span> The U.S. Department of Education requires Massachusetts to determine which districts (including single school districts) have specific needs for technical assistance or intervention in the area of special education. A district’s determination is based on five categories: Meets Requirements (MR); Meets Requirements-At Risk (MRAR); Needs Technical Assistance (NTA); Needs Intervention (NI); and Needs Substantial Intervention (NSI). In most cases these categories correspond to the district's accountability and assistance level, except when the district has specific compliance needs. This designation helps signal whether outcomes for all students in the district indicate progress, including that of students with disabilities, or whether technical assistance and/or intervention is needed to improve outcomes for all children, especially students with disabilities. Upon classification of a district into Level 3, two additional focus areas for special education will be reviewed at the district level and may require action: (A) over-identification of low-income students as eligible for special education and (B) inordinate separation of students with disabilities across low income and/or racial groups.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Focus on…(name of one or more subgroups):</span> Schools with one or more subgroups that are among the lowest performing subgroups statewide are classified into Level 3, and the names of those groups are displayed. For a subgroup to be low performing, it must meet two criteria: (1) the subgroup must place in the lowest performing 20 percent of like subgroups within the school type category statewide, and (2) the subgroup must place in the lowest performing 20 percent of all subgroups statewide within the same school type.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Commended for…(description of reason): </span> Formal recognition of a Level 1 school that demonstrates very high achievement, makes strong progress overall, or makes strong progress toward narrowing proficiency gaps in the current year.</p>
<p><span class="bold">School percentiles:</span> A school percentile between 1 and 99 is reported for schools with at least four years of data. This number is an indication of the school's overall performance relative to other schools that serve the same or similar grades. All schools are classified into one of five school type categories: (1) Elementary, usually schools serving grades K-5 or K-6; (2) Elementary/Middle, usually schools serving grades K-8); (3) Middle, usually schools serving grades 6-8 or 7-8; (4) Middle/High, usually schools serving grades 7-12 or K-12); and (5) High, usually schools serving grades 9-12). State law requires Massachusetts to classify into Level 3 those schools that are among the lowest performing 20 percent relative to other schools of the same school type. These schools are considered to be the lowest-achieving, least-improving schools in the state. For a school to be eligible for classification into Level 3 or assigned a percentile, it must have sufficient data to be compared to other schools based on achievement and improvement.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cumulative Progress and Performance Index (PPI):</span> The cumulative PPI combines information about narrowing proficiency gaps, growth, and graduation and dropout rates over the most recent four-year period into a single number between 0 and 100. All districts, schools, and groups with sufficient data are assigned an annual PPI based on two years of data and a cumulative PPI between 0 and 100 based on three annual PPIs. The annual PPI is a measure of the improvement that a group makes toward its own targets over a two-year period on up to seven indicators: narrowing proficiency gaps (in English language arts (ELA), mathematics, and science); growth (ELA and mathematics); the annual dropout rate; and the cohort graduation rate. The cumulative PPI is the average of a group's annual PPIs over four years, weighting the most recent years the most (1-2-3-4). A cumulative PPI is calculated for a group if it has at least three annual PPIs. If a group is missing an annual PPI for one year, that year is left out of the weighting (e.g., 1-X-3-4). While a group's annual PPI can exceed 100 points, the cumulative PPI is always reported on a 100-point scale. For a school to be considered to be making progress toward narrowing proficiency gaps, the cumulative PPI for both the "all students" group and high needs students must be 75 or higher.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Student groups:</span> School and district accountability determinations are made for the "all students" group and for up to 11 subgroups. Determinations are made for districts and schools (including single school districts and charter schools) that serve 20 or more students and for all subgroups of 30 or more students.</p>
<p><span class="bold">High needs students:</span> The new high needs group is an unduplicated count of all students in a school or district belonging to at least one of the following individual subgroups: students with disabilities, English language learners (ELL) and former ELL students, or low income students (eligible for free/reduced price school lunch). For a school to be considered to be making progress toward narrowing proficiency gaps, the cumulative PPI for both the "all students" group and high needs students must be 75 or higher.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Annual PPI:</span> The annual PPI is a measure of the improvement that a group makes toward its own targets over a two-year period on up to seven indicators: narrowing proficiency gaps (ELA, mathematics, and science); growth (ELA and mathematics); the annual dropout rate; and the cohort graduation rate. An annual PPI is calculated for all groups that assessed a sufficient number of students in ELA and mathematics in the most recent year and one of the two prior years (20 for schools, 30 for subgroups). A group is awarded 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 points based on this improvement. To be considered on target for a given indicator, a group must earn 75 points. A group that scores above target is awarded 100 points. The annual PPI is then calculated by dividing the total number of points earned for all indicators by the number of indicators. Organizations serving grades 9-12 and organizations that test students in science will have more indicators than others. If a group did not have 2012 data to measure improvement between 2012 and 2013, 2011 - if available - data are substituted in order calculate change.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cumulative PPI:</span> The cumulative PPI combines information about narrowing proficiency gaps, growth, and graduation and dropout rates over the most recent four-year period into a single number between 0 and 100. All districts, schools, and groups with sufficient data are assigned an annual PPI based on two years of data and a cumulative PPI between 0 and 100 based on three annual PPIs.

A cumulative PPI is calculated for a group if it has at least three annual PPIs. If a group is missing an annual PPI for one year, that year is left out of the weighting (e.g., 1-X-3-4). While a group’s annual PPI can exceed 100 points, the cumulative PPI is always reported on a 100-point scale. For a school to be considered to be making progress toward narrowing proficiency gaps, the cumulative PPI for both the "all students" group and high needs students must be 75 or higher.</p>
<p><span class="bold">MCAS Participation:</span> All districts, schools, and subgroups must assess at least 95 percent of their students on the ELA, mathematics, and science MCAS and/or the state English language acquisition assessment (for English language learners). Any school with less than 95 percent participation for any student group is ineligible for classification into Level 1 and is, at a minimum, classified into Level 2. Any school with less than 90 percent participation for any student group is automatically classified into Level 3.</p>

<tr><th><a id="Achievement">Proficiency Gap Narrowing (English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science)</a></th></tr>
<tr><td>All groups (districts, schools, and subgroups) are expected to halve the distance between their level of performance in 2011 and proficiency by the year 2017. Massachusetts uses the 100-point Composite Performance Index (CPI) to measure progress towards this goal of narrowing proficiency gaps. The CPI assigns 100, 75, 50, 25, or 0 points to each student participating in MCAS and MCAS-Alternate Assessment tests based how close they came to scoring Proficient or Advanced.  (For example, all students scoring Proficient or Advanced are assigned 100 CPI points; students with very low MCAS scores are assigned 0 CPI points.) The CPI is calculated by dividing the total number of points by the number of students in the group. The result is a number between 0 and 100. A CPI of 100 means that all students in a group are proficient.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p><span class="bold">2011 CPI (Baseline):</span> The baseline for the group's annual CPI target.*</p>
<p><span class="bold">2013 CPI:</span> The actual 2013 CPI for the group. A group is automatically awarded 100 PPI points and an "Above Target" rating if the 2013 CPI for the group is 97.5 or higher.</p>
<p><span class="bold">CPI Change:</span> The change in CPI from the prior year to the current year (can be negative). A group is awarded 100 PPI points and an "Above Target" rating for exceeding its annual target by more than 1.25 points. A group is awarded 75 PPI points and an "On Target" rating if the current year CPI is within plus or minus 1.25 points of its CPI target. A group receives partial credit (50 PPI points) for showing improvement in the CPI even if it is below target ("Improved Below Target"). If there is no change in CPI or the CPI declines slightly (up to -2.5 CPI points), the group is awarded 25 points ("No Change"). If the CPI declines by more than 2.5 points, the group is awarded 0 points ("Declined").</p>

<p><span class="bold">N:</span> The number of students whose assessment results were included in the 2013 CPI calculation for a given student group. For schools, this number includes only those students enrolled in the school on or before October 1, 2012 and who took MCAS or MCAS-Alt tests in the same school. For districts, including single school districts, this number includes all students who took MCAS/MCAS-Alt tests while enrolled in the district, regardless of when they enrolled. The district N figure includes students in out-of-district placements (i.e., those who attend a non-public school at public expense). All ELL students in their first year of U.S. schooling are excluded from the N figure, as are students who did not complete testing. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Met Safe Harbor?:</span> Indicates whether the percentage of students in the group not proficient decreased by 10 percent or more from the previous year. Unless the group met the criteria for earning 100 PPI points ("Above Target"), the group is automatically awarded 75 points and an "On Target" rating for meeting the federal "safe harbor" provision.</p>
<p><span class="bold">N:</span> The number of students whose assessment results were included in the 2013 growth calculation for a given student group. This number includes only those students enrolled in the school or district on or before October 1, 2012 and who took MCAS tests in the same school or district. The district N figure includes students in out-of-district placements (i.e., those who attend a non-public school at public expense). All ELL students in their first year of U.S. schooling are excluded from the N figure, as are students who did not complete testing or for whom ESE does not have consecutive years of MCAS results (for example, third grade students).</p>
